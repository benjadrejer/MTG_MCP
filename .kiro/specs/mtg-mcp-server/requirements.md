# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides functions to interact with the Magic the Gathering API. The server will enable AI assistants to retrieve card information, search for cards, and access MTG-related data through standardized MCP tools.

## Glossary

- **MCP Server**: A Model Context Protocol server that exposes tools and resources to AI assistants
- **MTG API**: The Magic the Gathering API available at https://api.magicthegathering.io
- **Card**: A Magic the Gathering playing card with attributes like name, mana cost, type, etc.
- **Set**: A collection of Magic the Gathering cards released together
- **Format**: A specific ruleset that determines which cards are legal for play

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI assistant user, I want to search for Magic the Gathering cards by name, so that I can get detailed information about specific cards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a card search by name, THE MCP_Server SHALL return matching card data from the MTG API
2. THE MCP_Server SHALL provide partial name matching capabilities for card searches
3. IF no cards match the search criteria, THEN THE MCP_Server SHALL return an appropriate empty result message
4. THE MCP_Server SHALL include card attributes such as name, mana cost, type, text, and power/toughness in search results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI assistant user, I want to retrieve cards by specific attributes like color or card type, so that I can find cards that meet certain criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user filters cards by color, THE MCP_Server SHALL return cards matching the specified color identity
2. WHEN a user filters cards by type, THE MCP_Server SHALL return cards of the specified type (creature, instant, sorcery, etc.)
3. THE MCP_Server SHALL support multiple filter combinations simultaneously
4. THE MCP_Server SHALL limit results to a reasonable number to prevent overwhelming responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI assistant user, I want to get information about Magic the Gathering sets, so that I can learn about different card collections and their release details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests set information, THE MCP_Server SHALL return set details including name, code, release date, and card count
2. THE MCP_Server SHALL provide the ability to search sets by name or set code
3. THE MCP_Server SHALL return a list of all available sets when no specific set is requested

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI assistant user, I want to get random Magic the Gathering cards, so that I can discover new cards or get inspiration for deck building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests random cards, THE MCP_Server SHALL return a specified number of random cards from the MTG API
2. THE MCP_Server SHALL default to returning 1 random card if no count is specified
3. THE MCP_Server SHALL limit the maximum number of random cards to prevent API abuse

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to handle API errors gracefully, so that the system remains stable when the MTG API is unavailable or returns errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MTG API returns an error response, THE MCP_Server SHALL return a descriptive error message to the user
2. WHEN the MTG API is unreachable, THE MCP_Server SHALL return a connection error message
3. THE MCP_Server SHALL implement appropriate timeout handling for API requests
4. THE MCP_Server SHALL log errors for debugging purposes while maintaining user-friendly error messages
